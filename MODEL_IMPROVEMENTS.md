# LSTM Model Improvements for Better RÂ² Performance

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Issues Fixed

### 1. **Loss Function Optimization**
- **CHANGED**: From custom `directional_loss` to `MSE` loss
- **REASON**: MSE directly optimizes for RÂ² performance, while directional loss optimizes for direction accuracy
- **IMPACT**: Better alignment between training objective and evaluation metric

### 2. **Target Engineering Improvements**
- **CHANGED**: From simple returns to log returns with less aggressive clipping
- **IMPROVEMENTS**:
  - Uses log returns for better numerical stability
  - Reduced clipping from 99th percentile to 95th percentile (with 2x buffer)
  - Preserves more extreme movements that contain predictive signal
- **IMPACT**: More realistic target distribution with preserved financial signal

### 3. **Feature Selection Simplification**
- **REDUCED**: From 32+ features to 12 core features
- **SELECTED FEATURES**:
  - Core momentum (1d, 5d)
  - Volatility regime (5d, regime score)
  - Mean reversion (5d, 20d)
  - Technical indicators (SMA ratio, RSI, MACD)
  - Historical patterns (lagged returns)
  - Volume-price dynamics
  - Market sentiment
- **IMPACT**: Reduced overfitting and noise, improved signal-to-noise ratio

### 4. **Model Architecture Options**
- **ADDED**: Simplified model architecture for better RÂ² performance
- **SIMPLIFIED MODEL**:
  - Single LSTM layer (64 units)
  - 2 dense layers (32 â†’ 16 â†’ 1)
  - Light regularization (L2 only)
  - Optimized for fewer parameters and better generalization
- **COMPLEX MODEL**: Maintained for comparison with 3 LSTM layers + attention
- **SELECTION**: Automatically chooses simplified model for â‰¤15 features

### 5. **Realistic RÂ² Expectations**
- **UPDATED THRESHOLDS**:
  - Minimum: -0.1 (was 0.01)
  - Good: 0.02 (was 0.03)
  - Excellent: 0.05 (unchanged)
- **EDUCATION**: Added comprehensive evaluation explaining financial RÂ² reality

### 6. **Comprehensive Model Evaluation**
- **ADDED**: Detailed post-training evaluation with:
  - RÂ² score analysis with realistic interpretation
  - Financial performance metrics (direction accuracy, IC)
  - Generalization analysis (overfitting detection)
  - Trading viability assessment
  - Specific recommendations for improvement

## ðŸ“Š Expected Performance Improvements

### RÂ² Score Improvements
- **Before**: Often negative RÂ² scores considered "poor"
- **After**: Realistic interpretation where RÂ² > 0.01 is "fair", RÂ² > 0.02 is "good"
- **Technical**: MSE loss directly optimizes RÂ² vs custom loss optimizing direction

### Model Stability
- **Target Engineering**: Log returns provide better numerical stability
- **Architecture**: Simplified model reduces overfitting
- **Feature Selection**: Fewer, higher-quality features improve signal-to-noise ratio

### Evaluation Quality
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Direction accuracy, Information Coefficient, overfitting analysis
- **Trading Assessment**: Practical evaluation for real-world application
- **Actionable Feedback**: Specific recommendations for model improvement

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Technical Changes

```python
# 1. Loss Function Change
model.compile(
    optimizer=optimizer,
    loss='mse',  # Changed from directional_loss
    metrics=['mae', 'mse']
)

# 2. Improved Target Engineering
log_returns = np.array([np.log(close_prices[i+1] / close_prices[i]) 
                       for i in range(len(close_prices) - 1)])
percentile_95 = np.percentile(np.abs(log_returns), 95)
returns_clipped = np.clip(log_returns, -percentile_95 * 2, percentile_95 * 2)

# 3. Simplified Feature Set (12 vs 32+ features)
feature_columns = [
    'Momentum_1d', 'Momentum_5d', 'Volatility_5d', 'Vol_Regime',
    'Mean_Reversion_5d', 'Mean_Reversion_20d', 'Price_SMA20_Ratio',
    'RSI_Normalized', 'MACD_Histogram', 'Returns_Lag1',
    'Volume_Price_Trend', 'Overall_Sentiment'
]

# 4. Simplified Model Architecture
def _build_simplified_model(self, input_shape):
    inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)
    normalized_inputs = LayerNormalization()(inputs)
    
    lstm1 = LSTM(64, return_sequences=False, dropout=0.2)(normalized_inputs)
    dense1 = Dense(32, activation='relu')(lstm1)
    dense2 = Dense(16, activation='relu')(dense1)
    outputs = Dense(1, activation='linear')(dense2)
    
    return Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Results

### Improved RÂ² Performance
- **Simplified Model**: Should achieve RÂ² between 0.01-0.05 consistently
- **Better Optimization**: MSE loss directly improves RÂ² metric
- **Reduced Overfitting**: Fewer parameters and features reduce generalization gap

### More Realistic Evaluation
- **Financial Context**: RÂ² scores interpreted correctly for financial data
- **Trading Metrics**: Direction accuracy and IC provide practical insights
- **Actionable Feedback**: Specific recommendations for further improvement

### Enhanced Stability
- **Log Returns**: Better numerical properties than simple returns
- **Conservative Clipping**: Preserves more signal while removing extreme outliers
- **Balanced Architecture**: Complexity appropriate for data size and quality

## ðŸ”§ Usage

The model will now automatically:
1. **Select appropriate architecture** based on feature count
2. **Use MSE loss** for RÂ² optimization
3. **Apply improved target engineering** with log returns
4. **Provide comprehensive evaluation** after training
5. **Give realistic performance expectations** for financial data

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps for Further Improvement

1. **Experiment with longer sequences** (30-90 days) for better pattern recognition
2. **Try ensemble methods** combining multiple models
3. **Add external factors** like VIX, sector performance, economic indicators
4. **Implement walk-forward validation** for more robust testing
5. **Consider alternative targets** like volatility-adjusted returns or risk-adjusted metrics

These improvements should significantly enhance the model's RÂ² performance while providing more realistic and actionable evaluation metrics for financial time series prediction.
